  - Interactive state selection for volunteer registration
  - Animated statistics and impact counters

### Design & Planning
- **Figma**: Created comprehensive wireframes and prototypes for:
  - User journey mapping for donation flows
  - Volunteer registration process
  - Impact storytelling sections
  - Mobile-responsive layouts

### Version Control
- **Git**: Maintained code versioning and collaboration

## Creative Features Added

- Provides personalized impact reports
- Offers custom thank-you messages and certificates

## Pricing Strategy & Product Flow

### Donation Tiers
Designed a multi-tiered donation structure:
