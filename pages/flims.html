                <p>Smile Foundation continuously strives to sensitize the privileged mass of the country so that they come forward, take on the social problems of the country as personal challenges and fight them back. And in order to grab their attention, Smile has been developing films on its core areas which are creative, innovative and are a balance of the right content and the right quality.</p><br>
                <p>Smile has forayed into producing films of both kinds â€“ documentary and short; and has been hugely successful in both the genres. The Foundation has also won several awards for its endeavors in both the categories.</p>
