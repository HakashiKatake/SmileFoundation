                        <p class="health-text">
                            Last mile delivery of healthcare is always challenging in a country as vast and diverse as India. The uneven distribution of healthcare infrastructure, as well as medical professionals, makes quality healthcare services inaccessible to a large population living in rural areas. Urban slum dwellers, on the other hand, suffer from a lack of awareness, adverse living conditions, and the unwillingness to lose a day's wage in order to reach the nearest medical facility.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="health-text">
                            To address these challenges, Smile Foundation's <strong>'Health Cannot Wait'</strong> initiative is taking quality healthcare services directly to the doorstep of vulnerable communities, with a focus on women and children. This initiative aims to strengthen the country's existing healthcare system and reduce out-of-pocket expenses on health for those who need it the most. Awareness activities like school health camps and street plays are also conducted to encourage children and communities to adopt health-seeking behaviors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="health-text">
                            <strong>But we can't do this alone.</strong> The harsh reality is that millions of underprivileged families in India still struggle to access basic healthcare, leading to preventable illnesses and even loss of life. Your support can change that. By contributing to the <strong>'Health Cannot Wait'</strong> initiative, you will ensure that essential medical care reaches those who need it most—right at their doorstep.

                            A mother's heart is tied to her child's. There is no doctor in our village. The nearest clinic is 5km away and we have to walk all that way. Two weeks ago, my daughter started crying continuously. I didn't know what to do. My husband was out for work. Me and my mother in law tried our best to soothe her, but she won't settle down. Then my mother in law said today is the day that the health van will come. The van started coming to our village once every 15 days, with doctors and free medicines. When I brought him to the medical van, the doctor told me she has diarrhoea. He gave me proper treatment guidelines and packets of ORS solution which helped to calm her. The moment she started smiling again, I was finally relieved!

                            I am a daily wage worker and the sole breadwinner for my family of five. Last year, I started experiencing severe pain in my chest but couldn't afford to miss work to visit a hospital. When the Smile Foundation organized a health camp in our community, I decided to get checked. The doctor diagnosed me with early-stage hypertension and immediately put me on medication. They also taught me about dietary changes and exercises. The free medicines they provided saved me from spending money I didn't have. Today, my blood pressure is under control, and I can continue working without worry. These health camps are a blessing for people like us who cannot afford to lose a day's wage.

                            During my pregnancy, I faced many complications but couldn't access proper healthcare as the nearest hospital was 20 kilometers away. The Smile Foundation's telemedicine center in our village became my lifeline. Through video consultations with gynecologists from the city hospital, I received proper care and guidance throughout my pregnancy. When it was time for delivery, they arranged emergency transport to the hospital. Today, both my son and I are healthy. Without the telemedicine facility, I don't know if we would have survived the complications. Now, I tell all expecting mothers in our village to use the telemedicine services for regular check-ups.

                        <p class="story-testimonial">
                            I used to miss school frequently because of recurring stomach infections. My parents are farmers and couldn't afford to take me to a private doctor. When Smile Foundation conducted a health camp at our school, the doctor identified that I had a parasitic infection due to unsafe drinking water. They provided me with medication and taught our family about water purification methods. They also installed a water filter at our school. It's been six months since then, and I haven't fallen sick. I can attend school regularly now and don't have to worry about stomach pain anymore. I want to become a doctor when I grow up and help children in my village just like the doctors who helped me.
